## start the game

You are jack. You have two buttons: "draw" and "stay". At the beginning they are disabled because the dealer has to give two cards.
To achieve this press "Kick off the game" button.

## play

Now you can press either "draw" or "stay". Play!

## result

Now you can see the result of the game. Maybe you won and therefore the badge "WINNER" appears next to your name.
